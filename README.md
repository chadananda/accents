Transliterated terminology collection and auto-replace project

### Next Steps:

* Continous 2-way sync data with remote CouchDB (it should be like one or two lines of code)
* Validation rules (both fields required, only one word on first field)
* As-you-type search for matching first field, show count of matches
* As-you type show list of similar terms directly below (terms that are the same after removal of diacritics)
* Formatted Content Editable input box
* Login based on admin users at remote DB (user/pass should allow access to remote DB)
* Save successful login in local DB (no sync) and don't force re-login unless > 2 hrs since last used
* Make app size to window
* Wrap up app in Node-Webkit wrapper for deployment to Mac and Windows
