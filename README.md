Transliterated terminology collection and auto-replace project

### Next Steps:

1. Continous 2-way sync data with remote CouchDB (it should be like one or two lines of code)
1. Validation rules (both fields required, only one word on first field)
1. As-you-type search for matching first field, show count of matches
1. As-you type show list of similar terms directly below (terms that are the same after removal of diacritics)
1. Formatted Content Editable input box
1. Login based on admin users at remote DB (user/pass should allow access to remote DB)
1. Save successful login in local DB (no sync) and don't force re-login unless > 2 hrs since last used (login button becomes 'logout' button)
1. Make app size to window
1. Wrap up app in Node-Webkit wrapper for deployment to Mac and Windows
