requirements:

Columns to import:
    "Original"(a) -> "original",
    "Times New Roman ebf engls"(b) ->  "term",
    "Definition"(e) -> "definition

The existing database looks like this:
http://accents.couchappy.com/_utils/document.html?accents/001B2279-E072-40CB-8797-B3BE12579A97
And example spreadsheet is here:

Filtering:
  The "term" field should not contain spaces. If a term with spaces is found, it should be split on spaces and each word added separately.
 The "term" field uses a custom font and needs to be translated into unicode. I'm not sure what all the characters are so we'll add that part at the very end.


 DB sample keys:
